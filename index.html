				<h2> Welcome! </h2> 
				<hr>
				<p> 
					Welcome to this website! To your left you will notice the directory, which 
					holds all the information this website has to offer. You may have figured out
					what this website is about, based on the title, but to clarify, this website will discuss 
					some of my favourite sea animals from each ocean basin we have on Earth. So first, what are oceans? 
				</p> 
				<p> 
					Oceans were created when gases started to appear on our planet. In the starting, 
					there was no oxygen or atmosphere. After it formed, it went through a tumultuous 
					period of being continually hit by rocks and meteoroids. Our Earth was able to create it's crust, 
					but with that came the issue of colliding tectonic plates, and volcanic eruptions, leading to the 
					atmosphere forming. And finally, it received rain, and water which slowly filled up the world's pits, and
					created oceans, lakes, and the such.
				</p>
				<p>
					For this reason we are one of a kind. Many planets have large bodies of water, but Earth is unique for
					the fact that it has water, <i> liquid </i> water, on the surface. If you wish to learn more about the different oceans, 
					it's parts, and the animals that may lurk there, follow this <a href="history.html"> link.</a> However, our oceans and the sea life in it
					are being hurt due to human activity and pollution. If you want to learn more about how we can prevent pollution and harming of our oceans and animals, 
					take a look at the protection page- <i> &#8220;How to protect our sea life and oceans&#8221; </i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This website will show the animals I find the most interesting, but I also urge you to check out some animals for yourself, 
					if there are any that interest you. There is much to find. All references used are in the references page, which can be accessed <a href="reference.html"> here.</a>
