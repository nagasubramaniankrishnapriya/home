				<p>
					We have only one ocean, 
					that covers 140 miles of Earth's surface. However, as humans, we have divided it up into 6 
					parts, 6 basins. Those being...

				<ul> 
					<!--List of oceans.-->
					<li> The Arctic Ocean 
						<ul>
							<li> Located around the North Pole </li>
							<li> Most of the water there is ice as the temperatures and sea temperatures are cold all year round. </li>
							<li> Many animals thrive in this cold environment.  </li>
							<li> Some remarkable sea animals in this environment are seals, orcas, and many more. Some of these animals only appear in the warmer seasons, such as summer, but some are there all year round. </li>

   				<ul>
					<li> The Pacific Ocean 
						<ul>
							<li> Pacific comes from the spanish word <i> Pacifico </i> meaning Peaceful. </li>
							<li> The largest ocean; 64 million square miles! </li>
							<li> Also the world's deepest oceans, more than 13,000 ft. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li> The Atlantic Ocean
						<ul>
							<li> Second largest ocean; 23 million square miles. </li>
							<li> Contains a mid-ocean ridge. </li>
							<li> Contains a lot of islands such as Cap Verde Islands and The Bahamas. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li> The Indian Ocean 
						<ul>
							<li> It is 28 million square miles. </li>
							<li> It is cornered by 3 continents, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. </li>
							<li> It is the largest breeding ground for humpback whales. Many endangered species are here too. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li> The Antarctic/Southern Ocean 
						<ul>
							<li> Is very recent addition to our oceans. It was recognized in 2000. </li>
							<li> This was formed by the southeren parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. This was the reason for the confusion and the controversy around it being it's own ocean. </li>

				<h3> Now.. </h3> 
				<p>
					Knowing this, let's get into the deeper parts of the ocean, and what animals may possibly 
					be there. 
					
					They are cut into 2 parts, the two regions being the <i> Benthic zone </i> and the <i> Pelagic zone </i>. 
					The pelagic zone is the zone closer to the surface, and the Benthic zones are those that are closer to the bottom of the ocean. 
					It is very hard for us to explore the deepest part of the ocean, that point being called &#8220; Challenger Deep &#8221;. Only 
					3 people have gone there, but it's pretty hard due to the immense pressure down there. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<!--Information about zones start here.-->
				<h3> Epipelagic Zone </h3>
				
				<p> 
					This zone is special, as it is the only part of the ocean that gets sunlight. Also known as the
					sunlight zone. Many common species of animals live in this zone, and this is where most phytoplankton and photosynthesizing organisms thrive and live. This 
					is where the ecosystem thrives, and where animals from the twilight zone swim up for food. 
					It reaches only to about 200 meters of the ocean. Most commonly, fishes, stingrays, turtles, and seals live here. As we start to go down, the pressure and darkness
					only increases. 
				</p>

   				</div>
				<h3> Mesopelagic Zone </h3>
				
				<p>
					This zone is also known as the twilight zone. This zone goes from 200 meters to 1000 meters deep. There are no photosynthesizing organisms here, but the 
					variety of animals is rich. Most of them will travel upward at night, to find food to prey on, and then swim back to keep safe from other predators. 
					Some just happen to be bioluminescent, and this is very useful as it is quite dark there. You will often find Cnidarias in this zone, such as jellyfish.
					Octopuses and krill also live here. This zone keeps a vital food web going as well. 	
				</p>
				
				
				<h3> Bathypelagic Zone </h3>
				
				<p>
					Also known as the midnight zone, it is around 1000-4000 meters deep. From here on out, 
					sunlight is not available to the creatures, it is pitch dark. Very very few creatures live here, and most of them 
					do not have eyes. We aso know very little about this zone, just like the twilight zone, because 
					of it's darkness and pressure, but we do know that the ecosystem there must be large and diverse. The infamous 
					anglerfish lives here, as do algae and the vampire fish. 
				</p>
				
				<h3> Abyssopelagic Zone  </h3>
				
				<p>
					4000-6000 meters deep, there is practically no sunlight here and lots of pressure. However, 
					animals still seem to thrive and survive in this harsh conditions. They survive in the many different ways 
					that they have to, for example some create their own, through the process of Chemoautotrophy. Others are scavengers, eating
					fallen animals and their dead lifeforms. There are probably more animals that we haven't even discovered yet!  
				</p>
				
				<h3> Hadalpelagic Zone </h3>
				
				<p>
					The hadalpelagic zone, or the hadal zone resides in the trenches that occur in the abyss zone. They are part 
					of the troughs and trenches in the oceans. The deepest point is Challenger Deep. In the Marina Trench, it is 10,924 meters and a very, <b> very </b>
					high amount of pressure. Shockingly, animals can still survive under these harsh conditions. (No Sunlight, Cold, Pressure) Commonly, 
					we will be able to see Amphipods and Snailfishes.
				</p>
				<!--Content ends here.-->
				<!--Summary starts here.-->
				<h3> Summary </h3>
				<p>
					So truly, there is a lot we have yet to know about our own oceans. There may be so much more hidden life down in the dark trenches, that we simply have not 
					been able to go down and explore, but one day we will be able to understand and explore all those hidden food webs and lifeforms. Our oceans, diverse in temperature, 
					organisms, and minerals, have a lot to offer to us. I hope you will also be interested in the ocean, and all the organisms within it.
