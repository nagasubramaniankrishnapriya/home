					Most of our oceans are slowly being polluted due to human activity and such. Most of the 
					animals I have talked about on the page <a href="sea_animals.html"> Sea Animals, </a> are endangered, such 
					as the Arctic Seal which is endangered. So how can we make sure these animals and the habitat they live in, are 
					protected?  
				</p>
				<h2> Protection </h2>
				<hr>
				<p> There are many ways we can protect our oceans and sea life. </p> <!--Ways to protect starts here.-->
					<ol>
						<li> 
							<h3> Raise Awareness/Volunteer </h3>
							<p>
								One can volunteer at their local beaches, help cleanup, and also help 
								raise awareness in their community, or at their school. By building communities
								that will help raise awareness, we can help protect them. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li> 
							<h3> Reduce Waste </h3>
							<p>
								A lot of waste ends up dumped in the oceans. An easy way to avoid this
								is to reduce your own waste. It starts with you, and through your actions, 
								you can get others to act as well. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li> 
							<h3> Fish responsibly </h3>
							<p>
								Overfishing or over hunting any sort of animal harms their population. Fish 
								only what you need, and continue on. That helps you be sustainable and other people will also have
								enough fish to fish for themselves, as well as leave time for this species to repopulate.  
							</p>
						</li>
						<li> 
							<h3> Support organizations that help this cause </h3>
							<p>
								Organizations like Oceana work to protect the 
								ocean. By supporting these organizations, you can also help create a better environment for the sea
								life, and a better ocean for all. 
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>	
					<p> Here's Oceana, an organization that might be useful to you.</p>
